Chattr-CodeDay
===============

An embedded website plugin allowing chats on any website (goal)

This was a project I worked on during my 24 hours of coding for CodeDay at Boston.

All that needs to be done is to include the script into your website and your good to go!

### Warnings

* This was hacked together in less than 24 hours, most of which was a learning experience, as I rarely ever use Javascript (my code looks terrible).

* There are a lot of bugs right now, as most of the features were rushed together in the last few hours of CodeDay.

* Bugs: Users sometimes don't get removed when disconnecting, user list gets messy when changing groups/ just doesn't work how it should.

### Features that NEED to be added

1. Upload files (click button to show pane of text when a file is uploaded?)

2. Fix user lists....

3. Add total concurrent users

4. Add removal of groups (admin users?)

5. Passworded groups

6. Fix Autolinks (kind of implemented)

7. Fix "Current Group" after clicking the cancel button while in a different group

8. Beta?

9. When user says something twice, do something similar to facebook?

* Fix bugs / warnings

### Current Features

* Can easily embed into a website

* Able to chat to people, either anonymously or with a name

* Able to create and join chat (groups) rooms

* All shown and stored in real-time using the Firebase API

### Installation

1. Embed the js to your header

2. Change firebaseURL to your own firebase database (optional, but do it)

3. Done?

### Other

I have a few projects for school that I need to finish up before I can start working on these personal projects and fixing them up (1-2 weeks?).

Have fun!

ChatApp-CodeDay
===============

An embedded website plugin allowing chats on any website (goal)

This was a project I worked on during my 24 hours of coding for CodeDay at Boston.

All that needs to be done is to include the script into your website and your good to go! (not fully working yet.. read on)

### Warnings

* This was hacked together in less than 24 hours, most of which was a learning experience, as I rarely ever use Javascript.

* There are a lot of bugs right now, as most of the features were rushed together in the last few hours of CodeDay.

* Bugs: Users sometimes don't get removed when disconnecting, user list gets messy when changing groups, others that I can't think of because I'm tired.

### Features that NEED to be added

* Unique identifiers for websites using this plugin without using their own firebase

* Ability to easily change the Firebase location

* Ability to use it properly as intended (style.css is locally set, and the goal is to use the script with a CDN, not by downloading it, unless you want to.)

* Upload files (click button to show pane of text when a file is uploaded?)

* Passworded groups

* Removal of groups

* Later: bookmarklet for users to use for themselves on ANY website!

### Current Features

* Can easily embed into a website

* Able to chat to people, either anonymously or with a name

* Able to create and join chat (groups) rooms

* All shown and stored in real-time using the Firebase API

### Installation

1. (temp): Download the js and css

2. Embed the js to your header

3. (temp): Edit the js to point to the css from anywhere

4. Done?

### Other

I'm exhausted, and I'm forgetting what else to add. I have a few projects for school that I need to finish up before I can start working on there personal projects (1-2 weeks?).

Have fun!
